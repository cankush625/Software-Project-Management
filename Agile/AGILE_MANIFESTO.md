## What is Agile Manifesto?
Agile manifesto is written as a response to the major issues with the traditional development processes in 1990s.

## Values/principles of Agile Manifesto:
1. <b>Prefer Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools:</b>  
    It's about having close physical proximity between stake holders and developers where they can make better
     decisions by discussing the issues.

    Eg. Scrum meetings or daily standups are an example of this principle, because it prefers individual  
        interactions rather that documenting everything.

2. <b>Prefer Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation:</b>  
    Working software is more important than comprehensive documentation. Comprehensive documentation is important but
     if we don't have working software, the documentation is useless.
    Using documents as a means of requirement gathering as a means of understanding what our client want is not a
     cost efficient way of approaching.

3. <b>Prefer Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation:</b>  
    When we put requirements in to contract, it is generally does not work great. We should not put requirements into the contract.  
    It makes sense to have measurable goals in contract. Sometimes, the requirements we put in the contract at the 
        start may not make sense when the project progresses. The requirements are fundamentally subject to change
        based on the environment.  
    So, it is better to prefer customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

4. <b>Prefer Responding to Change over Following a Plan:</b>  
    Systems are fundamentally subject to change.  
    The initial plan may be wrong, so we should not rigidly stick to the plan. We need to listen more to the clients, and
        whenever customer asks for a change, we should do the change. Because, the customer is the one who will use the
        system. The customer/client knows the value of feature better than us, because it is a system that a client want.
