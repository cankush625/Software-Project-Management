# Lehman's law of software evolution

Manny Lehman had proposed a law of software evolution known as Lehman's law of software evolution.  

Lehman said that these laws onlt applies to the certain type of systems. So, he devided system into three
type of categories.

1. S-Type systems:
    S-Type systems are the systems that have well known specifications, that have a well known solution.
    It possible to implement 100% correct solution.  
    Not a lot of systems we are working with fall under this category.
    In most of the cases when writing a software, we deal with E-Type systems in real world.
2. P-Type systems:
    P-Type systems might have a well known specific on how to reach 100% correct solution would be. There
    might be way to theoritically reaching that solution. But in practical, it will be hard to achieve that
    solution.
3. E-Type systems:
    E-Type systems are real world systems. Systems that are built with business processes, by real people.
    There may not be specification with 100% correctness, because it's changing with time. We are not sure 
    today what we want tomorrow.
